# Color-Shifting-Obstacle-Detector-Using-Ultrasonic-Sensor
The ultrasonic sensor detects objects and lights up Red, Yellow or Green LED based on its position.


It is a simple project to detect obstacles in various distances. The sonar sensor detects the distance between the object and the board and based on the distance from the board it lights up Red, Yellow and Green LED.

When the object is too close to the board (10 centimeters) it lights up Red LED as an indication of caution.

It lights up Yellow LED when the object is between 11-100 centimeter. If the object is detected outside of the 100-centimeter range, it lights up Green LED as an indication of the object in safe range.
